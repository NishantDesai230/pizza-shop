<p>Issuing a food disclaimer is considered a defensive tactic taken by a food producer against potential liabilities that it may have to face in the absence of the disclaimer.<br>Like a warning on a bottle of prescription drugs, a food disclaimer is a legal statement, which, in general, provides consumers with valuable information about the content of a food product.<br>Additionally, a food disclaimer may be required by law or FDA regulation.<br>  For example, a law in Louisiana was passed that requires:<br>

All establishments that sell or serve raw oysters must display signs, menu notices, table tents, or other clearly visible messages at the point of sale with either of the following wording:
<br>
1. “THERE MAY BE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMING RAW SHELLFISH AS IS THE CASE WITH OTHER RAW PROTEIN PRODUCTS. <br>IF YOU SUFFER FROM CHRONIC ILLNESS OF THE LIVER, STOMACH OR BLOOD OR HAVE OTHER IMMUNE DISORDERS, YOU SHOULD EAT THESE PRODUCTS FULLY COOKED”;<br>

or
<br>
2. “CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS.”<br>

Thus, a restaurant that serves oysters in Louisiana and fails to comply with its duty to place clear, visible warning signs at the point of sale relating to the dangers of consuming raw or uncooked shellfish or oysters could be liable to a patron who sustained an illness as a result of eating oysters.<br>

NOTE: Disclaimers are important and can provide some level of protection. <br>However, if you have a website, our terms and conditions contain several important disclaimers to help reduce your legal liability.<br> </p>
